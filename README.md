**Summary:**<br>
- Time spent working on the task: between 27 and 30 hours.<br>
- Bootstrap is the most popular HTML/CSS/JS framework for developing responsive projects.<br>
- Raleway is appropriate font-family for the task.<br>

- Font Awesome - vector icons<br>

- Lightbox JS library was used for the purpose of an image gallery<br>

- SevenX has some useful carousel collections<br>

- I used trial-and-error as a method of solving problems.<br>
- I spent a lot of time doing google searches (code snippets, image search, etc.)<br><br><br>

**If I had had more time I would have tried to:**<br>
- improve the navbar and the footer;<br>
- use jQuery.BlackAndWhite plugin;<br>

- implement SevenX Carousel Header Controls.<br>
